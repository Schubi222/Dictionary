# Dictionary
This project surved as a first contact with TS.<br/>
It was also the first use of async/await with vue. <br/>
It was the first time I tried estimating the time I would need - I exeeded it by 50% (that needs some work, but to be fair main time sinks were small things like CSS stuff and my IDE not working correctly).<br/>
It was also my first time working with changing the color theme. <br/>
